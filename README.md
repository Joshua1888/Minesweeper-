## A Story About Mineweeper Game

I used a computer for the first time when I was 3 years old. The first time I used a computer, I was fascinated by this huge machine that I operated with a mouse and keyboard. I didn't know many words or how to manipulate applications to accomplish tasks such as writing documents, searching for information on the Internet, or sending messages to others on Facebook. Still, as a kid, graphics appealed to me at the time. Through self-discovery, I found *Sipider Solitaire* and *Mineweeper* from the WinXP startup menu. and although I played both, Mineweeper's beautiful colorful graphics and fun gameplay appealed to me the most among all games I found. Now that I'm older, and windows has been updated from XP all the way to Win 11, I can still feel the fond memories of playing Mineweeper. I've noticed that fewer and fewer people play Mineweeper these days due to its outdated game desigs. **Therefore, as a second year computer science student, I would like to generate a new version of Mineweeper to commemorate my childhood and bringing more people back to this game again.**

The game I designed is suitable for all computer users, especially gamers and those people with nostalgia for the old days. This game replicates the original gameplay of dragging and dropping cards to a fixed position and using card sorting to win. In addition to this game there will be some new features such as music and other additional gameplay.


## User Stories
- As a user, I want games add multiple **mines** to a the **game board**.

- As a user, I wish the game list all the **mines** in my **game board** in two dimensions.

- As a user, I wish I can self customize the game about the size of the board and the number of bomb.

- As a user, I wish I can cick the cell through input x and y coordinates.

- As a user, when I select the quit option from the application menu, I want to be reminded to save my to-do list to file and have the option to do so or not.

- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my to-do list from file.
